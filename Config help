Many people prefer to buy electronics directly from showroom/store rather than online!!
This is bcz they find it easier to seek help in a store(by enquiring people in store) and then find their "perfect" product matching their requirements.
Whereas in a website they get confused about their requirements.
My idea is to have a Config help section where the user gets help about his minimum or "ideal" req.

For example:

Suppose there is a user who needs buy a washing machine, but has no clue about the config the machine must have.
When he gets into the config help section, he will be asked certain questions like:
What product u want to buy?  (He will choose Washing machine)
How many clothes do you want to fill-in per wash?  (He will choose 10 - 20)
Do you want dryer option? (He chooses yes)
Want any extra features like anti-tangle, anti-wrinkle, soundless?  (He selects none)

Our help suggestion will be:

Capacity 6.5 Kg: Suitable for families with 3 to 4 members
RPM 680 : Higher spin speeds helps in faster drying
6 Wash Programs : Normal, Quick wash, Delicates, Soak + Normal, Energy Saving, Eco Tub Clean

This suggestion gives him an idea about the config and he can find his product without any external help

<< The details given by the user could also be used for product recommendation (ML) >>
